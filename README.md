# KinSvarmo

KinSvarmo is a scientific agent marketplace and execution platform where researchers publish private analysis agents as 0G-linked iNFT-style assets, and users run auditable analysis workflows on uploaded datasets.

The current demo includes a seeded marketplace, integrated landing and marketplace pages, a working Alkaloid Predictor execution path, a classroom pulse reviewer with an anonymized sample dataset, AXL-backed planner/analyzer/critic/reporter communication, KeeperHub workflow tracking, and dedicated job/result pages. The wallet and 0G contract path depends on the final deployed registry address.

```

## Demo Flow

1. Open the landing page.
2. Browse seeded scientific agents.
3. Open `Alkaloid Predictor v2` or `Classroom Pulse Reviewer`.
4. Upload the matching sample dataset.
5. Start the backend job.
6. Watch planner, analyzer, critic, and reporter progress.
7. Inspect true AXL message routes and KeeperHub execution state.
8. Open the final result page with confidence, key findings, structured JSON, and provenance.

## Local Setup

```bash
pnpm install
```

Create and enable the real KeeperHub webhook workflow:

```bash
pnpm keeperhub:create-webhook
pnpm keeperhub:test
```

## One-Command Local Demo

Start local AXL-compatible nodes, agent workers, API, and web app:

```bash
pnpm demo:local
```

In another terminal, verify the stack:

```bash
pnpm demo:check
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:3000/agents/1
```

## Manual Local AXL Demo

Run the local AXL-compatible node network:

```bash
pnpm axl:nodes
```

In a second terminal:

```bash
pnpm axl:workers
```

In a third terminal:

```bash
pnpm axl:demo
```

This sends a demo job through planner, analyzer, critic, and reporter as separate processes.

## API Job Workflow

The backend job flow is driven by AXL messages. `POST /api/jobs/:id/start` sends `job.created` to the planner node, then the API consumes AXL messages sent back by the workers to update module status, message logs, and final result state.

The UI displays the true worker route for audit messages, so the status page shows `planner → analyzer → critic → reporter` even when the API receives an audit copy for state tracking.

## Demo Dataset

The deterministic phytochemistry sample lives at `demo-data/alkaloid-sample.csv`.

The anonymized classroom sample lives at `demo-data/classroom-pulse-sample.csv`. It uses synthetic student IDs and coarse classroom metrics so the agent can be demoed without exposing learner data.

## Repository Checks

Repository-level tests live in `scripts/tests`.

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm test:axl
pnpm typecheck
```

AXL-specific setup and live-node smoke testing are documented in `docs/axl-adapter-testing.md`.

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local API/demo development and fill KeeperHub values. The frontend can use `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000` when the API service runs separately.

Wallet authorization requires a deployed iNFT registry address:

```text
NEXT_PUBLIC_INFT_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=0x...
```

## Current Status

- Seeded marketplace with six catalog agents.
- `Alkaloid Predictor v2` and `Classroom Pulse Reviewer` have deterministic local demo coverage.
- API job creation, AXL workflow start, message logging, KeeperHub tracking, and result retrieval work locally.
- Dedicated job status and result pages exist.
- Local AXL-compatible nodes and real Gensyn AXL smoke-test scripts exist.
- KeeperHub workflow creation, enabling, and live testing scripts exist.

## Known Limitations

- Some marketplace agents are preview listings until their domain-specific execution adapters are connected.
- In-memory job state is used for the local demo. Persistence should later become an index/cache over 0G/onchain references, not the source of truth.
- Wallet authorization requires the final 0G registry deployment address and a wallet on 0G Galileo Testnet.
